{"index":{"title":"Home","links":[],"tags":[],"content":"Welcome. I’ve been keeping a Zettelkasten for about 3 years now, and I’ve accumulated nearly 2500 notes. And I enjoy reading other people’s Zettelkasten too, such as rwxrob’s. It shows me what they’re currently obsessed with or working on, and I like to follow their journeys in that way.\nPublishing my writing to the world started with my tech blog. I wrote about my journey into DevOps and what I was learning along the way, and found it to be an enjoyable practice.\nIf you are interesed in following me I suggest you add this website to your preferred RSS reader  so you get regular updates.\nIf you wish to get in touch with me, take a look at mischavandenburg.com\nTopics - Entry points for Exploration\nIndex notes will be listed here."}}
